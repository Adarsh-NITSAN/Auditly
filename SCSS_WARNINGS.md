# SCSS Deprecation Warnings - Resolved

## What Were the Warnings?

The build was showing SCSS deprecation warnings from Bootstrap's internal SCSS files:

### 1. Legacy JS API Deprecation
```
Deprecation Warning [legacy-js-api]: The legacy JS API is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.
```
- **Cause**: Bootstrap's SCSS files use the legacy JavaScript API
- **Impact**: None - just a warning about future compatibility

### 2. @import Rules Deprecation
```
Deprecation Warning [import]: Sass @import rules are deprecated and will be removed in Sass 3.0.0.
```
- **Cause**: Bootstrap uses `@import` instead of `@use` (newer syntax)
- **Impact**: None - will need updating when Sass 3.0.0 is released

### 3. Global Built-in Functions Deprecation
```
Deprecation Warning [global-builtin]: Global built-in functions are deprecated
```
- **Cause**: Functions like `mix()`, `unit()` used without namespace
- **Impact**: None - just a warning about future syntax

### 4. Color Functions Deprecation
```
Deprecation Warning [color-functions]: red() is deprecated
```
- **Cause**: Color functions like `red()`, `green()`, `blue()` are deprecated
- **Impact**: None - just a warning about future syntax

## How Were They Fixed?

### 1. Vite Configuration
Updated `vite.config.ts` to suppress warnings:
```typescript
css: {
  preprocessorOptions: {
    scss: {
      quietDeps: true, // Suppress deprecation warnings from dependencies
      silenceDeprecations: ['legacy-js-api', 'import', 'global-builtin', 'color-functions']
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Global Sass Configuration
Created `.sassrc` file for global Sass options:
```json
{
  "quietDeps": true,
  "silenceDeprecations": [
    "legacy-js-api",
    "import", 
    "global-builtin",
    "color-functions"
  ],
  "style": "compressed",
  "loadPaths": ["node_modules"]
}
```

## Current Status

âœ… **Warnings Suppressed**: Build output is now clean
âœ… **Functionality Unchanged**: All features work exactly the same
âœ… **Future-Proof**: Ready for Sass updates when Bootstrap updates

## Important Notes

- These were **warnings, not errors** - your build was always successful
- The warnings came from Bootstrap's internal files, not your code
- Bootstrap will eventually update their SCSS to use modern syntax
- Your custom SCSS in `src/styles/main.scss` is already using modern syntax

## When Bootstrap Updates

When Bootstrap releases a version with updated SCSS syntax:
1. Update Bootstrap: `npm update bootstrap`
2. Remove the warning suppression from Vite config
3. Delete the `.sassrc` file

Until then, the warnings are safely suppressed and your build process is clean! ðŸŽ‰
